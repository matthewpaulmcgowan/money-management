# Specifications for the Angular Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Use Angular to build the app
      Angular is used.

- [X] Must contain some sort of nested views
      The Home state is initially loaded. Login and Signin are nested beneath the home state.

- [X] Must contain some sort of searching as well as filtering based on some criteria. Ex: All items in the "fruit" category, or all tasks past due
      Includes the ability to search and a filter for spending items over $100.

- [X] Must contain at least one page that allows for dynamic updating of a single field of a resource. Ex: Allow changing of quantity in a shopping cart
      The update item page allows to update any of the fields.

- [X] Links should work correctly. Ex: Clicking on a product in a list, should take you to the show page for that product
      I believe all links go to where they should.

- [X] Data should be validated in Angular before submission
      Angular validates the fields are filled and ngMessages is used to display errors.

- [X] Must talk to the Rails backend using $http and Services
      The app talks to Rails using Services and $http.

- [X] Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code
      The README.md covers required sections.

Confirm
- [X] You have a large number of small Git commits
- [X] Your commit messages are meaningful
- [X] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message
- [X] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
I worked hard to push a larger number of smaller git commmits with meaningful messages and solely pertinent changes.
